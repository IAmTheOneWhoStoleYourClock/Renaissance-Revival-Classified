Renaissance Revival ported to TF2Classified with some changes and features.

<br>As of writing this pack is still getting actively updated.
<br>Join the "official" server for the modpack at 165.227.42.9:27015, or look for Newfenland in your server browser.
<br>If you would like to host the pack, get in touch! I'd be happy to help with hosting it in regions I frankly can't afford to myself.
<br>You are free to use the pack as you wish, although i'd just personally prefer if you didn't host anything with serious variations without my prior knowledge. Mashups are fine but i'd still love to hear about it!
<br>This is intended to be played in medieval mode AT ALL TIMES. Change tf_medieval to 1 play locally on non-medieval maps.
<br>Feel free to contact me on Discord (@theclockstealer) or join my discord server at https://discord.gg/eAh63UtMuz
<br>Report any bugs either here or on my discord (PLEASE don't do it in the TF2Classified discord...)
<br>Just a note, this pack is NOT intended to be a static recreation of the original pack, I will add additional content and changes as I see fit to make a more fun experience
